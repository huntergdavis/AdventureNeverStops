Adventure Never Stops

An RPG that plays itself, modernized.  

Backstory
After The Grind was removed for the play store for a DMCA violation for using a troll face meme, I was eager to just replace the meme with my own image and re-upload V4 to the play store.

Sadly, as I looked through the code I realized there was a lot I'd like to do with the Grind, things that wouldn't be possible with the hacked together architecture for this game I created in a day 5 years ago. 

So, I'm starting from scratch.  No dependencies on any of my old game libraries or game engines etc.  A fresh take on an RPG that plays itself for you.
